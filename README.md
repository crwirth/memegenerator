# Meme Generator

For this project I built a meme generator for the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

My generator consists of a form that accepts a link to an image, text for the top of the meme, and text for the bottom of the meme. When the user submits the form, it uses JavaScript to append to the DOM a div which contains the meme, including the image and its text.

- User should is able to submit a form on the page to generate a new meme on the page, and is able to add multiple memes to the page by submitting the form multiple times.
- Users is able to click on a button to remove a meme from the page.
- When the meme form is submitted, values in the form inputs are cleared.
